# Vector Tangent: A Challenge Problem

Write an algorithm that calculates the tangent of any arbitrary angle (in degrees) with the following restrictions:
- The use of trigonometric functions is prohibited unless comparing the calculated value to the actual value returned by `std::tan`.
- The use of the built-in square root function is prohibited.

**Your solution must use vectors.**
